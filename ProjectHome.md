# Introduction #
This is a demo Android project showing how it's possible to have QuickActions and Popdown menu interface actions like those in the Twitter App.

## Details ##

After playing with the Twitter for Android app and watching the Google I/O talk I wanted to be able to use some of those UI actions in my applications. The problem is that these actions are not built into the framework. Even though they have promised to open source the code I really wanted to start using them now. The hint that it was possible was when Romain Guy said it was really simple, coupled with the fact that Twitter for Android will run on any 2.0+ device.

This demo project is not meant to be a completely functional UI component that can be dropped directly into your project. It's only meant to display how you can create the same UI elements that were featured in the Twitter for Android app.

## Caveats ##

This demo code does not look like the Twitter for Android QuickActions? and Popdown menu. This is intentional, as it is style dependent on the application. I left the styling alone and focused solely on the mechanics.

Also, code was tested only on a 2.1 device and only in 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 emulators. It is released in a "It works for me" state. :)
